                        <p class="history-text">I go to school in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, a small, rural town where 
history is everywhere, even if you don't notice it at first. For a long time, 
I didn't.</p>
                        <p class="history-text">I walked past old buildings every day without thinking twice about them. 
They were just… there. But one day, on an especially chilly walk to 
McDonald's, I started wondering: There has to be a story behind all of this.
So I started researching. What I found amazed me. Each building, street, 
and corner had its own story, full of people, events, and moments that 
shaped the town.</p>
                        <p class="history-text">I began collecting these stories to share with others. That's how Word on 
the Street was born — a project to uncover the stories around us, 
share them with others, and hopefully inspire everyone to discover the 
history in their own neighborhoods.</p>
