They lived along the fertile lands of the <strong>Conococheague Creek</strong> in the Great Appalachian Valley, hunting and growing crops. These Native Americans knew how to live in harmony with the land, using the forests, rivers, and fields for everything they needed.'

He purchased land from Native Americans for a gun and a string of beads - a common way people made agreements back then. James built a small log grist mill on the creek, where farmers could bring their grain to be ground into flour.',
                'The mill became so important that the little settlement was called <strong>"Black\'s Town"</strong>! More families arrived, building houses around the mill and opening stores. Life on the frontier was exciting but also dangerous.'

General Mercer was a Scottish-American doctor who had practiced medicine in the area before the war. He bravely fought for American independence and died in 1777 from wounds received at the Battle of Princeton.',

This made Mercersburg a crucial stop on the <strong>Underground Railroad</strong>.',

African American communities grew, working in agriculture and trades. The town center was known as "Black Town," and rural areas as "Little Africa."
